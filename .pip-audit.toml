# pip-audit configuration
# Suppress vulnerabilities that don't apply to Logarithmic

[tool.pip-audit]
# Ignore urllib3 SSRF vulnerabilities - they only affect Pyodide runtime (browser/Node.js)
# Logarithmic is a desktop application and doesn't use Pyodide
ignore-vulns = [
    "GHSA-48p4-8xcf-vxj5",  # urllib3 SSRF in Pyodide - redirect control bypass
    "GHSA-pq67-6m6q-mj2v",  # urllib3 SSRF in Pyodide - XMLHttpRequest/Fetch API
]

# Rationale:
# - These vulnerabilities only affect urllib3 when running in a Pyodide runtime
# - Pyodide is a Python distribution for WebAssembly (browser/Node.js environments)
# - Logarithmic is a native desktop application (PySide6/Qt) that doesn't use Pyodide
# - The kubernetes package (34.1.0) requires urllib3<2.4.0, blocking the upgrade
# - We're waiting for kubernetes 35.x to be released with urllib3 2.5.0 support
# - Risk assessment: NONE - vulnerability doesn't apply to our runtime environment
