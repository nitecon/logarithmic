# Privacy Policy for Logarithmic

Last updated: November 15, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how Runtime Dynamics LLC ("we," "us," or "our") handles information in relation to your use of the Logarithmic desktop application (the "Application").

## I. Our Core Privacy Principle

Logarithmic is a privacy-first application. It is designed to be a secure, local-only tool.

Our core principle is simple: We do not collect, store, transmit, or have access to any of your personal data. All your information, settings, and log files remain on your computer, under your control.

## II. Information We Do Not Collect

To be perfectly clear, we do not collect:

Personal Information: We do not ask for, collect, or store your name, email address, phone number, or any other personal identifiers.

Account Information: The Application is a standalone desktop app and does not require an account to use.

Usage Data or Analytics: We do not use any analytics tools (like Google Analytics or Umami) to track how you use the Application. We do not know which features you use, how often you open the app, or your IP address.

Crash Reports: The Application does not automatically send crash or error logs to us.

## III. How the Application Uses Your Local Data

Logarithmic needs to access certain data on your computer locally to function. This data is never sent to us or any third party.

Log Files: The Application accesses and reads log files that you explicitly select via the "Open" dialog or by adding a path. This file access is read-only and is required for the app to tail and display the log content to you.

Session & Settings Data: The Application saves your preferences, such as saved log file paths, window positions, and UI settings (like font sizes), to a local file on your device. This is done purely for your convenience, allowing you to save and restore your sessions. You have full control over this data and can delete it at any time by clearing the application's local storage.

Model Context Protocol (MCP) Server: The Application includes an optional MCP server.

This feature is disabled by default.

If you choose to enable it, it runs only on your local machine (e.g., 127.0.0.1) to allow other applications on your computer (like Claude Desktop) to communicate with Logarithmic.

No data from this server is ever sent to Runtime Dynamics LLC or any external service.

## IV. Information We Do Not Share

Since we do not collect any of your data, we have no data to share, sell, or disclose to any third parties.

## V. Data Security

Your data (your log files and your local settings) is stored on your device's hard drive. The security of this data is protected by the built-in security features of your operating system (macOS).

## VI. Children's Privacy

Logarithmic is a developer tool and may be used by individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect, use, or store any information from anyone, including children.

## VII. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.
